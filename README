This is the code for the project. The graphs that it will produce can be found in the main directory.

In order to run the program the suggested method is open the project in IntelliJ. The IML file has been known to cause some problems so if that does occur the JARs necessary for external libraries have been also included in the lib folder. It is possible that your IDK (ideally 1.8) will not include tools.jar. This can be manually added from intelliJ.

Enjoy!
